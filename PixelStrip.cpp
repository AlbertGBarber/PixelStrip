//improvments TODO:
			  //. write an exponential dimming function (and allow trail length setting on patternSweep) (done, but exp dimming might be off)
			  //. change dimming function to always use crossfade function, need to make funct to return bg color
			  //. allow switching pallets on the fly --> wont be needed with nodelay rewrite
			  //. BgColor setting code is repeated a few times --> make into funct? (done)
			  //. allow setting bg as a gradient? (done)
			  //. allow using bg gradient for the main color in patternSweep, colorSpin, and colorWipe functions (done)
			  //. check for repeates of single pixel BgColor setting code (done)
			  //. go through comments, make sure they outline all functionality
			  //. check variable types for consistency
			  //. see if drawPattern funct can be used more
			  //. rewrite splitColor to return array of rgb comps (done)
			  //. allow setting of zero point for fireV2 (done, along with changing the color)
			  //. look at fire, update it
			  //. rewrite crossfadeRandomPattern to take a pallet (need a search function to make pallets)
			  //. rewrite patterSweep to set last pixels off instead of redrawing whole BG each time (done)
			  //. rewrite patterSweep patterns to include -1, 1 instead of 1, 0 for direction
			  //. allow pattern sweep to contain different trail types in one pattern
			  //. check if palletLength is needed in color wipe functs (done)
			  //. check limits on color wipe functs
			  //. let you choose direction for pattern sweep rand
			  //. make dimming variables global, including the pattenSweep rainbow adjustments
			  //. remove patternSweep rainbow functs? not needed since b/c of color mode
			  //. re-write spinPattern, it is very restrictive about BG
			  //. add step rates to simple repeat, and wave functions?
			  //. patternSweepRepeat is memory with large patterns (sorta fixed with gradientCycle)
			  //. add radial rainbow to drawLineSimple (done, need to update/replace functions that call it) (done)
			  //. simpleRepeatPattern takes up to much memory, isnt 255 pixel compatible
			  //. add a direction to segments, which treats their pixels in reverse order (done) -----> fox segment functions to not clash with this
			  //. make RGB stored in PROGMEM, not sure how to work with dynamic ones (canceled, dont use RGB for variables in .ino)
			  //. fix end points on gradientCycle (done sorta, the dot doesn't always happen, depends on the lengths)
			  //. make shooter take an array of variable lengths --> write helper function for a fixed length {done} --> also made one that takes segments (but only continuons ones) (done)
			  //. look at reworking patternSweep, it's slow with a lot of pixels, rework desaturate funct
			  //. for shooterSeg, let you split the segments into pieces?
			  //. rewrite do simple repeat pattern to not use crossfadeRandom, instead repeat the pattern down the strip
			  //. blend the colors in fireV2 for a more nuanced fire (done)
			  //. add the ability to shift a rainbow bg / anything that uses wheel by adding and offset parameter (you could also do this of the BgGradient)
			 
//Patterns TODO: 
		  //. a proper fireworks routine (trails fade over time), could be a mod of the patternSweep with exponentially dimming trails
		  //. Draw pattern based on segments, (basically a static colorSpin)
		  //. a proper rainbow mode for color spin, cycles through rainbow based on longest segment? (done)
		  //. a colorWipe version of colorSpin (done)
		  //. a "shooter" pattern, like patternSweep, but the pixels only cycle round once (done)
		  //. an automated section color wipe, wipes a series of different sized sections in colors (done)
		  //. a segmented version of PatternSweep
		  //. segmented version of firev2 (done)
		  //. a function that cycles through an array of patterns
		  //. function that crossfades between colors (done w/ random too)
		  //. a radial version of the color spinFunction (ie a waves function that takes patterns)
		  //. a stacking pattern I guess
		  //. a simple function to crossfade through a set of colors (done)
		  //. a less memory intensive streamer function (done)
		  //. low memory version of waves (done)
		  //. a colorWipe function that does random length wipes
		  //. radial color wipe funct (done)
		  //. a static waves function (ie a BG that doesn't change as waves move), write like a radial patternSweep
		  //. random color waves function (done)
		  //. color spin simple pallet rand
		  //. simple steamer where it takes a pallet, no pattern (like simpleWaves)
		  //. shooter that takes only one color (maybe use the palletLength for the color and a mode?) (right now, you need to make a one length pallet)
		  //. a gradient segment function that repeats the same gradient down each segment (done)
		  //. add a rainbow mode to shooter seg where the rainbow is destributed down the seg
		  //. gradientSweep rainbow (needs direction setting in segment definition)

//A traditional fire loop, most useful for strips with a diffuser
//code modified from https://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/arduino/adruino-led-strip-effects/#fire
//draws a a random fire along the strip
//Works with segments, draws an individual fire along each segment
//Note that this doesn't work well with small segments, minimum length is 15+
//takes an RGB pallet[] of colors which are used to generate the fire:
	//the pallet must be ordered from the coldest to the hottest color (generally lightest to darkest)
	//pallets can be of any length, although 3 - 4 colors seems to work best for normal fires
	//try { Color(255, 0, 0), Color(255, 143, 0) , Color(255, 255, 255) } for a tranditional fire
	//or {Color(238, 130, 238),  Color(123, 7, 197) , Color(225, 0, 127), Color(255, 255, 255) } for a pink/purple fire
//The other variables determine how the fire is drawn:
	//Cooling: indicates how fast a flame cools down. More cooling means shorter flames, 
	//recommended values are between 20 and 100. 50 seems the nicest.
	
	//Sparking: indicates the chance (out of 255) that a spark will ignite. A higher value makes the fire more active. 
	//Suggested values lay between 50 and 200. 120 works well.
	
	//forward: sets the direction that the inital fire burns in, 
	//setting it true means the fire starts at the start of each segment, otherwise it will start at the end of each segment
	
	//alternating: if true, then subesequent fires will reverse direction on their segment
